ParanoidAndroid-legacy 4.4 device tree for the Samsung Galaxy Ace II X (GT-S7560M)

AOSPA-legacy is based around CM (all aospa project have been mereged with cm-11.0) so ALL fixes on my forked CM projects are applicable on aospa-legacy.

Since aospa-legacy deleted their frameworks_webview project of their github,you need to remove it from default.xml in order to get things synced.
Since its pretty important project you can use AOSPA frameworks_webview as long as you match its branches with the rest of the source (dont clone anyother branch than kitkat).

As I said,since its merged with CM you can use all my cm forks (except frameworks_av and frameworks_base,but you can reuse commits in these projects).

As always legacymod/display-legacy IS A MUST in order too boot,
for wifi you need legacymod atheros 
AND for bluetooth you need to remove bluedroid and replace it with bluez project which can be obtained (along with Bluetooth application project that supports bluez) from KlinkOnE github page.

Other than that theres not much to say,ROM is pretty neat and runs well,
be sure to use make3.82-make4.1,other will give you strange dependencies issues and missing symbols.
